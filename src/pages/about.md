  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">About Me</h1>
  <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-neutral-600">
    I am a final-year undergraduate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), pursuing a major of MATH-CS.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-neutral-600">
    My primary research interest lies at the intersection of numerical analysis and deep learning. I am currently working on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and analyzing the effects of floating-point precision in optimization algorithms. My research collaborations are with groups at Dartmouth College and UC Berkeley.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-neutral-600">
    After graduation, I plan to pursue a PhD in the United States and contribute to the field of Scientific Machine Learning.
