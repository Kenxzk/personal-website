      SAGA is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing educational support and companionship to children with leukemia. As a team leader, I am responsible for managing and coordinating a team of over 200 volunteer teachers.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-neutral-600">
      In addition to my leadership role, I design and teach a weekly curriculum focused on mathematics and language, aiming to create an engaging and supportive learning environment for the children. This experience has been incredibly rewarding and has significantly honed my organizational and communication skills.
